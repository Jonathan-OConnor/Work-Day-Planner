# Work-Day-Planner

## Description
This is a simple day planner application. The user can write text into a field corresponding to each hour of the standard work day and save what they have written. The colors of the rows correspond to the time of the day. The row is gray if the hour has already past, the row is green if the hour is later in the day, and the row is yellow if it is currently that hour.
